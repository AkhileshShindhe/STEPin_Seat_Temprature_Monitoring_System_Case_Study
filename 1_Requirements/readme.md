A Heated seats are a standard feature on many vehicles thesedays in cold

areas. They provide the driver and passengers with a pleasantly warm seat

at all times, even in winter. The desired temperature is usually set in several

levels. This can be activated by control of knob which will be allotted for it

or by actuating the buttons manually , depending on the configuration

installed. We can also implement the option of adjusting the temperature in

the seat cushion and backrest areas according to personal perception of

the temperature in each area. Heated seats are used increasingly in conjunction

with climate controlled ventilation, which removes any condensing moisture from the

seat.

**Features**

· A flexible approach system

· The implementation of this project leads for adjusting passenger

seat temperatures according to their adjustments.

· Driver or Passenger has the access to modify the temperature in

the vehicle.

· As per the passengers requirement, Heater will generate the heat

accordingly when they tune the knob of control.

· It is best for those countries where the room temperature will be

below -5\* Celsius .

· This system is cost effective and user friendly.

**SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities**

**Threats**

**Strengths**





· Easy adoptable system.

· We can adjust temperature accordingly in a easier way.

· Flexible Approach

· It’s a cost-effective and a robust system.

**Weakness**

· Its only applicable for those countries which are having low

temperature.

**Opportunities**

· If possible we can covert this system to both heater and cooler

application

**Threats**

· Doesn’t fit good for the places where the room temperature is

above 20\* Celsius.
